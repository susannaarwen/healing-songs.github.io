<section class = "song blue-banisters">
    <h2>Blue Banisters</h2>
    <h3>Lana del Rey</h3>
    <p>From her 2021 album of the same name, Blue Banisters by Lana del Rey is one of the softest, gentlest, most tender songs that I have ever heard.</p>
    <p>My favourite part of the song is at the very end of the song.<br><br>''Summer comes,<br>Winter goes,<br>Spring I skip,<br> God knows.'' <br></p>
    <p>And all of the bits after that.</p>
    <p>For me this song is all about acceptance.</p>

    <h2>Paradise</h2>
    <h3>Coldplay</h3>
    <p>This song came out when I was 18. I wish that you could know how I was feeling. This song makes me feel like I could do anything in the world. Kind of like in the previous song, Blue Banisters, this song is all about acceptance.</p>
    <p>With the line 'She said, oh, I know the sun must set to rise', I feel there is a kind of acceptance.</p>
    <p>This song just speaks to the dreamer in me.</p>
    <p>It is such a feelgood song, the ultimate one!</p>
    <p>Imagine just finishing school and having this playing all the time.</p>
    <p>It was the best thing ever, oh my god.</p>

  <section class ="song biking-home">
    <h2>Biking Home</h2>
    <h3>Lisa Gerrard</h3>
    <p>This song represents to me alignment. Being true to yourself and following your destiny.</p>
    <p>Now what could possibly be more healing than that?</p>
    <p>There are no lyrics in this song, but there are some lines of dialogue in Maori at the end</p>
    <p>The reason for this being, this is from the soundtrack of one of my favourite films, the Whale Rider!!!</p>
    <p>If you have not seen this film, then I highly highly recommend it. Check it out!</p>

  <section class = "song womankind">
    <h2>Womankind</h2>
    <h3>Emily Jane White</h3>
    <p>This is honestly one of the most healing songs that I have ever heard in life. It was actually my most played song of 2022!</p>
    <p>The day I discovered it I just played this song for hours and hours on end. It articulated so many of the things I have never known how to say</p>
    <p>But it's so empowering as well!</p>
    <p>There is power in being understood and being validated. Ulaimately, that is what this song did to me. It put into words a lot of things that I could never say.</p>
    <p>'Our body's not a public space<br>
    Corporal autonomous space<br>
    Hands that enter your space<br>
    They violate the whole human race.'</p>

  <section class = "song yosemite">
    <h2>Yosemite</h2>
    <h3>Lana Del Rey</h3>
    <p>This is the most healing song of all! It is so soft, and so gentle, and so magical, and mysterious.</p>
    <p>If you've been following my coding journey, you'll know that I consistently quote and reference this song. The reason for this is that Lana del Rey sings about doing things 'for the right reasons'. And I fundamentally want to believe that I am doing coding for the right reasons: that I am doing it for the good of the whole.</p>
    <p>"We did it for fun, we did for for free<br>
    From when I was young, 'til eternity<br>
    We did it for the right reasons<br>
    Withstanding all of time, changes and seasons<br>
    Right reasons."

    <h2>Venice Bitch</h2>
    <h3>Lana Del Rey</h3>
    <p>I've been battling internally with myself whether to keep this in or not, but I finally decided to put it back in.</p>
    <p>This is a beautiful, healing song. It got me through a couple of nights where I just really needed to do some healing and to keep going.</p>
    <p>It'd a 10 minute song!!! Can you believe it? For Lana del Rey.</p>
    <p>It's a very progressive rock song with psychadelic undertones</p>
    <p>But ultimately yes, I love how this song progresses from one thing to another. It starts off in one place and it ends up in a completely different place.</p>
    <p>As one fan said on YouTube, "As long as this song exists, summer will never end." </p>

  <section class = "song slow-burn">
    <h2>Slow Burn</h2>
    <h3>Kacey Musgraves</h3>
    <p>For me, this is one of the most healing songs ever.</p>
    <p>The softness, the gentless, the stillness, that is encompassed in this song, for me is just on another level.</p>
    <p>And everybody that I recommend it to falls in love with it too!</p>
    <p>But this is what happened to me as well you see. One of my trainers recommended it to me in my very first job, when I was working in customer services</p>
    <p>Ultimately, this song is what got me through the training, which was very very very hard and very difficult for someone who is neurodivergent!</p>
    <p>My favourite part in this song is just when she goes 'Mmmh-mmmh-mmmh-mmmh-mmmh-mmmmh' at the start of the 3rd verse.<br>So soft.<br>So powerful.<br>And so gentle.</p>

    <h2>Speed of Sound</h2>
    <h3>Coldplay</h3>
    <p>Yes, I know, it's so embarassing.</p>
    <p>Please don't disown me!</p>
    <p>But I love this song so, so, so much!</p>
    <p>For me, it is the ultimate feel-good song.</p>
    <p>In fact, when I was little, then I just used to think of it as the 'ultimate' song. Just like I used to think of English as the 'ultimate' - language - although I have spoken many languages since I was very young, I used to think of English as the one which had all the correct form etc. (lol). In the same way, I used to think of this opening riff as 'THE BEST SONG EVER'.</p>
    <p>With all other songs merely aspiring to that.</p>

    <h3>Vasco Rossi</h3>
    <p>Picture the scene.</p>
    <p>It is a beautiful late autumn evening. There is a full moon.</p>
    <p>I have just been to the pub with my colleagues. We had a great night, but I stayed on dancing. They all left.</p>
    <p>So naturally I made friends with a group of about 8 Italians, the only other enthusiastic dancers in the pub.</p>
    <p>I decided to go back to their after party.</p>
    <p>As we walked back in the moonlight across 7 Dials in Brighton, the boy I was walking with put this song on.</p>
    <p>He changed my life forever. I love this song.</p>
